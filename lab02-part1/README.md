# 02_ExpressJS
This is the second lab for a course on backend web development using Node.

This is basically [Lab01](/lab01) but using `express` instead of the `http` module, and with the possibility to fetch dummy values as metrics.

Note that you must now pass your name in the url path instead of querystrings.

## Installation
Make sure you clone this repository first and `cd` into it
```
cd lab01
npm install
```
> You can also use `yarn`

## Usage
Just run
```
npm start
```
You can then access the server through [port 8096](http://127.0.0.1:8096/)
